Welcome to the Dorm Seating program for SSFS.

This software will create eight weeks of seating charts for dorm students eating dinner in the dining hall.  No two table seatings during this time will be alike.

Necessary Files:
--------------------
The program looks for two text files (usually they have been created in a program like Notepad).  The first is for students.  The student file must be in the following form:

Name, (d)omestic or (i)nternational.

For example, the file might look like:

Sam Student,i
Sally Student,d
Sarah Student,d
Sean Student,i

There must be a comma between the name and the "country" with NO space after the comma.  Currently, the d or i does nothing, but hopefully future versions of the program will take this information into account.

The second critical file is the staff file.  The two peices of information in this file are the name of the staff person sitting at the table and the number of available seats at that table.  The pieces of information are again separated by a comma (no space after comma).  For example:
Terry Teacher,6
Tammy Teacher,5
Ted Teacher,3

********************************************************************
IMPORTANT: The number of students MUST EQUAL the number of available seats!

Running the Program
--------------------
1. After opening the program, click the "Choose Student File" button to open the text file containing the list of students.  The file MUST be a .txt file.

2. The list of students will be shown in the window to the right which can be scrolled.

3. Click on the "Choose Staff File" button to open the text file containing the staff names and number of available seats.

4. The list of staff members will be shown in the window to the right.

5. If all looks well, click the "Create Seating" button.  You will be asked to choose a name and location for the seating file.  You have the option to save it as a text file or as a Word document.

6. The program may take up to a minute or two to create the file.  The bar will show you the progress of the operation.  The file is finished when a box pops up saying that the operation has been completed.

7. You may now open your file in Word and make any formatting changes you desire.

Editing the Files
-------------------
If the files need to be edited for any reason, e.g. student or staff leaves, there are two ways to make changes:

1. Open the files directly and make any needed changes, making sure to save when finished.

2. After clicking the button when the program is running, the corresponding file is loaded into the window on the right.  You can actually make changes in that window, then click the save button when finished.  MAKE SURE TO SAVE OVER THE ORIGINAL FILE YOU OPENED!!  Don't create a new saved file.

Future Versions and Feature Requests
------------------------------------
A future goal of this program is to seat based on country.  This would require a completely different algorithm, so don't look for it anytime soon.  If, however, you have other ideas for program functionality, please email me at:
